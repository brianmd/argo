[![Clojarsroject](http://clojars.org/argo/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/argo)

Argo is a Clojure library to help build APIs in Clojure that conform to the [JSON API 1.0 specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/).

The library is still in its early stages and does not yet fully adhere to the specification. However, most of the main areas of the spec
are already covered.

See the [example implentation](https://github.com/stephenmuss/argo/blob/master/example/src/example/api.clj) for basic usage.
